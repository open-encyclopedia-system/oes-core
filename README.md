# Open Encyclopedia System Plugin

Welcome to the main Open Encyclopedia System (OES) repository on GitHub. OES is a modular and configurable software for creating, publishing and maintaining online encyclopedias in the humanities and social sciences that are accessible worldwide via Open Access. OES adds a web-based open source software for article-based publication formats to already available options for electronic publishing and thus closes existing gaps in the Open Access publishing landscape.

The development of the Open Encyclopedia System Software was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) from 2016-2020 as part of the project From 1914-1918-online to the Open Encyclopedia System (see GEPRIS entry). For more information about the project and existing OES applications please visit our [website](http://www.open-encyclopedia-system.org/).

OES is a WordPress plugin, developed on WordPress version 5.9..
An OES application consists of a OES plugin, an additional OES project plugin which implements the OES features for the application and an optional OES theme.
OES requires PHP 7.4.
