Building and maintaining online encyclopedias.

## Description
The Open Encyclopedia System (OES) is a modular and configurable software for creating, publishing and maintaining
online encyclopedias in the humanities and social sciences that are accessible worldwide via Open Access. OES adds a
web-based open source software for article-based publication formats to already available options for electronic
publishing and thus closes existing gaps in the Open Access publishing landscape.

The development of the Open Encyclopedia System Software was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) from
2016-2020 as part of the project From 1914-1918-online to the Open Encyclopedia System (see GEPRIS entry). For more
information about the project and existing OES applications please visit our
[website](http://www.open-encyclopedia-system.org/).

## Features
* Publish citable articles
* Include version control for published articles
* Edit and administer relations between entities
* Use linked open data APIs to GND
* Manage user, posts, entities, access rights and role models
* Use the OES configuration interface to change the appearance of the published articles
